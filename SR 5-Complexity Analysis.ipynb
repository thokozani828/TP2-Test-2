    "## Explanation of Time and Space Complexity of Linear Search\n",
    "Linear Search\n",
    "Time Complexity: \n",
    "- In the worst case, the linear search algorithm needs to check each element of the list once to find the target element, leading to a linear time complexity.\n",
    "#### Best Case:\n",
    "- if the target element is found at the first position.\n",
    "#### Average Case:\n",
    "- as on average, the target element will be somewhere in the middle of the list\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Efficiency in Terms of Big-O Notation\n",
    "- Simple to implement.\n",
    "- No need for the list to be sorted.\n",
    "- Works well with small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space Complexity: \n",
    "- It does not use any additional data structures that grow with the input size, hence the space complexity is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Efficiency in Terms of Big-O Notation\n",
    "- Linear search is efficient for small datasets and unsorted lists.\n",
    "- For larger datasets, it becomes inefficient due to its linear time complexity.\n",
    "- Suitable for scenarios where the list is unsorted and the overhead of sorting for binary search is not justified."
